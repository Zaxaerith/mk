# Super Mario Kart — Static Recompilation

Static recompilation of **Super Mario Kart** (SNES, 1992) from WDC 65C816 assembly to native C code, playable on modern hardware via SDL2.

Part of the [sp00nznet](https://github.com/sp00nznet) recompilation portfolio. This is the first SNES (65816 CPU) target in the series.

> **Contribution branch note:** `contrib/recompiler-correctness` is an experimental fork branch
> focused on generator coverage, deterministic ROM-oracle validation, and exact timed native C
> execution. It is **not yet a complete C recompile**: the default playable path still executes a
> user-supplied ROM through LakeSnes. See
> [`docs/contribution_status.md`](docs/contribution_status.md) for the exact scope, reproducible
> validation commands, current results, and remaining work.

## Status

**Playable end-to-end.** A cold boot walks the authentic flow from controller input —
title → driver select → 50cc class / cup select → a live **Mode-7 race** — with a Dear
ImGui menu bar, save-states, configurable keyboard + gamepad controls for two players, and
**lockstep netplay**. The SNES hardware (PPU Modes 0–7, SPC700 + DSP audio, DMA/HDMA, DSP-1
coprocessor) is fully emulated by the LakeSnes backend.

Two execution paths share the same backend: **real-frame mode** (the default) runs the
genuine ROM through LakeSnes's cycle-accurate frame, so the whole game plays today; the
**recompiled-shell path** (`SMK_SHELLS=1`) runs hand-written `RECOMP_PATCH` functions and is
where the static-recompilation work grows incrementally. Recompiled functions are defined
with `RECOMP_PATCH(name, snes_addr) { ... }` and auto-register in snesrecomp's dispatch table
at static-init time — adding a translated function is a one-line change, no central list.

The full menu flow runs from controller input — title → driver select → class/cup select:

The Mode-7 race renders and plays — perspective track, karts, HUD, split-screen:

**Lockstep netplay** — two machines run the same deterministic emulation in sync (host =
Player 1, client = Player 2), starting from a shared save-state:

A Dear ImGui menu bar (File / Graphics / Sound / Controller / Multiplayer / Help) overlays the game — see [Menu](#menu).

### What works
- **Full authentic flow from controller input** — title → driver select → 50cc class / cup
  select → Mode-7 race, all driven by the genuine ROM's state sequencer (`$81:E000`)
- **Mode-7 race** rendering + gameplay: perspective track, karts, HUD, lap timer, split-screen
- **Dear ImGui menu** overlaying the game — File / Graphics / Sound / Controller / Multiplayer / Help
- **Save-states** — File → Save/Load (and F5/F8), full machine state via LakeSnes; File → New resets
- **Configurable input** for **both players** — rebind keyboard *and* Xbox-style gamepad per button
- **Lockstep netplay** (TCP) with input-delay buffering — host/join, save-state sync on connect,
  deterministic in-sync emulation (verified by matching WRAM checksums)
- Full boot chain: reset vector → hardware init → WRAM 0x55 fill → PPU/APU/DSP-1 setup → Mode-7 tables
- Custom tile/tilemap decompressor (`$84:E09E`) — all 7 compression modes + E0+ extended counts
- Joypad/auto-joypad input with edge detection; real palettes ROM → CGRAM; per-scanline HDMA
- LakeSnes renders all PPU scanlines per frame; SDL2 window (3× scale by default), 60 fps, audio

### What's next
- **Grow the recompiled-shell path** (`SMK_SHELLS=1`) to drive gameplay — currently the shells
  render the menus but the Mode-7 race's multi-frame init/fade-in needs the real frame
  (the default real-frame path handles it). See `docs/smk_flow_re.md`.
- Netplay polish: rollback / over-the-wire desync detection; "drop straight into 2-player on connect"
- More recompiled functions (the long-term goal: replace real-frame with recompiled C)

### Recent (August 2026)
- **Measured full-C baseline and roadmap** — the standard 1,400-frame route reaches 361 direct
  call targets. 81 C entries are registered (32 auto-generated), but only the strict 18-function
  combined set is default oracle-gated; see [`docs/recompilation_roadmap.md`](docs/recompilation_roadmap.md).
- **Generator arithmetic expansion** — added runtime-decimal-correct 8/16-bit ADC/SBC for
  existing memory modes plus NOP. This unlocks several high-frequency math routines; the
  `$81:F638` indirect-call closure is retained as an exact-timing regression rather than being
  prematurely default-enabled.
- **Auto-recompiler correctness pass** — fixed mid-function entries whose CFG branches into
  lower-address shared blocks; added M/X-width-correct register stack operations, PHK/PHD/PLD,
  TSB/TRB, and the remaining register transfers, with focused Python regression tests.
- **Two more race-path functions recompiled** — `$80:8EED` (backward/shared CFG) and `$81:BB70`
  (hot RTL bit-mixing leaf). The default 18-function timed-recomp set completed a scripted
  1,400-frame title → menus → race → driving run with 11,794 native interceptions and
  byte-identical WRAM/VRAM/CGRAM snapshots versus the ROM interpreter outside the documented
  dead stack-scratch range `$1F00-$1FFF`.
- Transition-sensitive `$80:9EB2`, `$81:81C4`, and `$85:92F9` remain generated but opt-in;
  the default set no longer claims them as oracle-safe.

### Recent (June 2026)
- **Cracked the menu→race flow** — root-caused the long-standing menu blocker to a power-on
  WRAM fill (`$2E` game-mode read as 2-player on a zero-filled RAM); fixed with a `0x55` fill
  matching hardware/snes9x. Full RE writeup in [`docs/smk_flow_re.md`](docs/smk_flow_re.md),
  cracked headlessly via a BizHawk + snes9x-core harness (`tools/bizhawk/`).
- **Real-frame mode** — runs the genuine ROM via LakeSnes's full frame so the whole game plays now.
- **ImGui menu, save-states, 2-player input, and lockstep netplay** added to snesrecomp (generic).
- **Fixed a real `s_pixel_buf` overflow** (478 vs 480 rows) that silently zeroed adjacent statics.

### Earlier
- **Auto-registered dispatch** via `RECOMP_PATCH(name, snes_addr) { ... }` — linker-priority static
  constructors, no central list. Pattern inspired by N64Recomp's `RECOMP_PATCH`.
- **Public 65816 op kit** — `<snesrecomp/cpu_ops.h>` (`op_lda_*`, `op_sta_*`, `op_rep`, …).

```

In the **recompiled-shell path** (`SMK_SHELLS=1`), recompiled game code acts as the CPU — it
calls `bus_read8(bank, addr)` / `bus_write8(bank, addr, val)`, which route through LakeSnes's
real memory bus to the actual PPU, APU, DMA, and cartridge hardware. In the **default
real-frame path**, LakeSnes's own CPU executes the genuine ROM each frame (`snes_runFrame`)
— identical to a cycle-accurate emulator — so the full game plays while the recompiled
functions are still being written. Either way, all PPU/APU/DMA behaviour is real.

## Controls

Default Player 1 keyboard (rebindable in the menu):

| Key | SNES Button |
|-----|-------------|
| Arrow keys | D-pad |
| Z | B |
| X | Y |
| A | A |
| S | X |
| Q | L |
| W | R |
| Enter | Start |
| Right Shift | Select |
| F5 / F8 | Save / Load state |
| Escape | Quit |

**Gamepads** (Xbox-style, via SDL_GameController) work out of the box for both
players — A→B, B→A, X→Y, Y→X, shoulders→L/R, Back→Select, Start→Start, d-pad and
left stick steer. Rebind any of it in **Controller** (P1/P2 tabs).

## Menu

A Dear ImGui menu bar (modelled on [LinksAwakening](https://github.com/sp00nznet/LinksAwakening))
overlays the game:

- **File** — New (reset/restart), Save / Load state (`smk_state.sav`; also **F5 / F8**),
  Settings ▸ (save/load `smk_config.ini`), Quit
- **Graphics** — window scale, V-Sync, texture filter, scanlines, show FPS
- **Sound** — master volume, mute
- **Controller** — rebind keyboard **and** gamepad for **Player 1 and Player 2**
- **Multiplayer** — Host / Join (IP:port), input-delay, connection status — lockstep netplay
- **Help → About** — links back to this repository

The menu auto-disables in headless/scripted runs (`SMK_HEADLESS`/`SMK_SCRIPT`).

## Building

### Prerequisites
- CMake 3.16+
- Visual Studio 2022 (MSVC)
- vcpkg (SDL2 is declared and version-locked by `vcpkg.json`)
- Python 3.10+ (for disassembler and analysis tools)

### Build

```bash
cmake -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

cmake --build build --config Debug
```

Run the auto-recompiler regression tests with:

```bash
python -m unittest tools/recomp/test_autogen.py -v
```

### Run

```bash
build/Debug/smk_launcher.exe
```

When no ROM argument is supplied, the launcher searches its current/executable directory and
up to two parent directories. This allows a Release/Debug executable to be double-clicked while
the legally supplied ROM remains at the repository root. An explicit ROM path is still accepted.

The ROM file is not included — supply your own US v1.0 copy (MD5: `7f25ce5a283d902694c52fb1152fa61a`).

By default the launcher runs in **real-frame mode** — the genuine ROM via LakeSnes's
full cycle-accurate frame — so menus *and* the Mode-7 race render and play at full
speed out of the box. (The recompiled per-frame shells can't yet drive the race's
multi-frame setup; as gameplay functions are recompiled they take over.)

For recompilation development, use the recompiled-shell path:

```bash
SMK_SHELLS=1 build/Debug/smk_launcher.exe           # recompiled per-frame shells
```

Set `SMK_RECOMP_PROFILE=1` to rank direct call targets. The default report shows 40 rows;
`SMK_RECOMP_PROFILE_TOP=1000` exports the complete observed set. Targets seen under more than
one accumulator/index width include an exact `VARIANTS=...` list for safe CFG generation.

Timed native validation can replace selected ROM routines while retaining LakeSnes's real frame
loop. When validating a complete generated call closure, disable interpreter force explicitly;
otherwise registered children are intentionally routed through the untimed diagnostic fallback:

```bash
SMK_RECOMP=1 SMK_INTERP=0 SMK_RECOMP_BUSPHASE=1 SMK_RECOMP_PHASE_YIELD=1 \
SMK_RECOMP_INTERCEPTS=81F638:L build/Debug/smk_launcher.exe
```

`$81:F638` and its eight indirect JSR targets are the first exact-timing closure gated this way:
2,715 interceptions match the 1,400-frame WRAM/VRAM/CGRAM oracle at all 140 sampled frames. The
generated call-frame token preserves caller SP/PB, prevents interpreter fallback from pushing a
second return frame, and suspends the timed hook while fallback executes. The bus-phase/yield path
is still opt-in while exact interrupt sampling and remaining bus-order cases are implemented.

## Decompressor

The custom decompressor at `$84:E09E` handles SMK's tile/tilemap compression format:

| Mode | Encoding | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `$00` | Raw | Copy N bytes from stream |
| `$20` | RLE | Repeat 1 byte N times |
| `$40` | Word fill | Alternate 2 bytes for N entries |
| `$60` | Inc fill | Store incrementing byte N times |
| `$80` | Backref | Copy from earlier in buffer (abs offset + base) |
| `$A0` | Inv backref | Copy with XOR $FF (inverted) |
| `$C0` | Byte backref | Copy from buf_pos - offset (1-byte offset) |

Commands `$E0`–`$FE` use extended 10-bit counts: 1 data byte + cmd bits 0-1 as high bits.
