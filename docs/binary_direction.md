# Direction algorithms recovered from ROM

Checkpoint: 2026-09-19. These functions reconstruct observable calculations;
names describe the recovered mathematics, not original source symbols.

## $81:F638: signed vector to quantized direction

`smk_vector_direction(x, y, table)` implements the A/carry result of the root
and its eight computed-JSR callees ($F6C7 through $F710). Preconditions are
native mode, 16-bit A/X/Y and binary arithmetic (D clear). The 4097-byte table
parameter represents runtime RAM beginning at `$7F:8FFF`. It is not included
in the repository.

Zero X is handled before any magnitude calculation: negative Y returns zero,
positive Y returns `$8000`; the zero vector returns zero with carry set. With
nonzero X and zero Y, positive X returns `$4000`, negative X `$C000`. Every
nonzero vector returns carry clear.

Otherwise signs select an octant. Compare absolute magnitudes *before* shifting
them; equality selects the Y-major branch. Shift both right until the larger is
at most 63. The byte index is `64 * minor + major`. Read a little-endian word
there, apply the octant's add/subtract/reflection and retain its high byte.
All intermediate arithmetic wraps like the original 16-bit CPU. Negation is
widened in C to correctly handle -32768.

The Y-major negative-X/negative-Y case is subtly different: mask the table word
to its high byte *before* negating. This matters for arbitrary table low bytes.
The pure implementation preserves that sequence.

## $81:FD22: direction from packed grid-cell center

`smk_direction_from_cell(cell, point_x, point_y, table)` recovers the caller:

```
center_x = (cell & 63) * 16 + 8
center_y = ((cell >> 6) & 63) * 16 + 8
delta_x  = signed16(point_x - center_x)
delta_y  = signed16(point_y - center_y)
direction = vector_direction(delta_x, delta_y, table)
```

The original loads the position from `DB:$0900,Y` and `DB:$0A00,Y`. The pure
API accepts those values directly, returns both deltas, and preserves 16-bit
wrapping before interpreting their signs. The packed cell's high four bits
do not affect the calculation. Calling these coordinates a 64x64 grid with
16-unit cells is an inference from the bit fields and center offsets; a specific
gameplay use (AI, collision, navigation) still requires caller analysis.

## Direct ROM differential gate

Build Release and execute:

```sh
build-manifest/Release/test_vector_direction.exe "Super Mario Kart (USA).sfc"
```

The test executes actual ROM instructions with LakeSnes's CPU. The memory
adapter supplies only routine code, stack, scratch words, position values and
the table. Unexpected accesses and nontermination fail. No translated C routine
is used as the reference.

Three synthetic table patterns (zero, all ones, and position-dependent bytes)
exercise the formulas without embedding game data. Results:

- **6,489,603 vector cases**: dense [-128,128] square plus 16 boundary values
  swept against the entire signed 16-bit domain in both orientations, for all
  three table patterns.
- **1,572,864 cell cases**: all 65,536 packed words, eight position patterns
  including cell centers and wrapping boundaries, for all three table patterns.
- Existing word mixer: **131,072 cases** still pass; 35 generator tests and
  Release build pass.

Vector tests compare A/carry and preserved Y/DB/DP/SP/status-width state. Cell
tests additionally check scratch deltas and preserved packed X. They do not
assert all scratch/register/flag side effects of the vector routine, and do
not exhaust the full 2^32 vector space or every possible table. Decimal mode,
interrupts, bus timing and concurrent table mutation are outside these APIs.

The game still uses the timed generated routines. These pure algorithms are
compiled into the library and the test executable, but do not replace timed
interceptions. Registered/generated entry counts therefore remain 85/37.
