# Recompiler correctness contribution branch

This document describes the public `contrib/recompiler-correctness` branch in the
[`Zaxaerith/mk`](https://github.com/Zaxaerith/mk) fork. The branch is based on
[`sp00nznet/mk`](https://github.com/sp00nznet/mk) and is intended for study, validation, and
incremental contribution toward a complete WDC 65C816-to-C recompilation.

## Scope and current state

The project is playable, but playability and recompilation completeness are different metrics:

- The default **real-frame** path runs the user-supplied game ROM on LakeSnes and is playable
  end-to-end.
- The **recompiled-shell** and **timed-recomp** paths execute selected translated C functions and
  are the paths being expanded toward full C ownership.
- A standard deterministic 1,400-frame title-to-race route observes 361 direct call targets.
  Fifty-six already have registered C entries and all remaining 305 generate successfully for
  their observed M/X entry variants (`unsupported: 0`).
- The repository currently registers 81 C entries, including 32 generated functions. Only
  oracle-gated subsets are enabled by default; generation success alone is not treated as proof
  of runtime correctness.

The first difficult exact-timing closure is now green. `$81:F638` and all eight of its indirect
JSR targets execute as native C with bus-phase timing. Across 2,715 root interceptions, all 140
sampled snapshots through frame 1,400 match the ROM reference byte-for-byte, including stack
WRAM. The default 18-function set executes 11,794 native interceptions and matches all observable
state when the documented dead stack-scratch range `$1F00-$1FFF` is excluded.

## What this branch does not claim

- It is not a complete C recompile of the game.
- It does not yet replace the LakeSnes-owned reset/NMI/main-frame scheduler.
- Bus-phase timing remains opt-in. Generated immediate, implied, branch, data-access, RMW,
  stack, JSR/JSL, RTS, and RTL paths now place `checkInt` at their LakeSnes micro-phase, but
  indirect jumps, block moves, RTI, DMA stalls, page/direct-page penalties, and open-bus behavior
  still need exact modeling. JSL's delayed bank-operand order is implemented, but still needs a
  standard-route all-C child closure for ROM-level validation.
- Passing the standard route does not prove every game mode, character, cup, track, multiplayer
  path, or long-running race.
- Interpreter fallback is stack-safe but intentionally untimed; it is excluded from exact-closure
  claims.

[`own_recompiler_design.md`](own_recompiler_design.md) for implementation notes.

## Repository and submodule layout

This branch points `ext/snesrecomp` at the
[`Zaxaerith/snesrecomp`](https://github.com/Zaxaerith/snesrecomp) fork because the call-frame and
timing-yield runtime changes must be available before the parent project can be checked out
reproducibly. Clone with submodules:

```bash
git clone --branch contrib/recompiler-correctness --recurse-submodules \
  https://github.com/Zaxaerith/mk.git
cd mk
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## ROM and legal boundary

No game ROM, firmware, save-state, validation snapshot, trace, screenshot dump, executable, or
other extracted game asset is included by this contribution. `.sfc`, `.smc`, firmware, runtime
state, build directories, and diagnostic outputs are ignored by Git.

To run or validate the project, supply your own legally obtained US v1.0 ROM. The expected MD5 is
`7f25ce5a283d902694c52fb1152fa61a`. Keep it at the repository root as
`Super Mario Kart (USA).sfc`, or pass an explicit path to the launcher.

## Build and unit test

Requirements are Visual Studio 2022, CMake 3.16+, Python 3.10+, and vcpkg. SDL2 is declared in
`vcpkg.json`.

```bash
cmake -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build build --config Release --target smk_launcher
python -m unittest tools.recomp.test_autogen -v
```

The launcher searches its own directory and up to two parent directories for the ROM, so the
Release executable may be launched directly while the ROM remains at the repository root.

## Deterministic validation route

The standard controller script is:

```text
360:Y,360:START,420:START,480:START,540:START,600:START,
660:START,720:START,780:START,840:START,900:START,960:START,
1120-1399:B
```

Generate a reference snapshot set with real-frame ROM execution, then run the exact C closure
with these additional environment variables:

```text
SMK_HEADLESS=1
SMK_MAX_FRAMES=1400
SMK_SNAPSHOT_EVERY=10
SMK_INTERP=0
SMK_RECOMP=1
SMK_RECOMP_INTERCEPTS=81F638:L
SMK_RECOMP_BUSPHASE=1
SMK_RECOMP_PHASE_YIELD=1
```

Use a different `SMK_SNAPSHOT_PREFIX` for the reference and test runs, then compare them:

```bash
python tools/diff_snapshots.py path/to/reference/snap path/to/test/snap
```

The acceptance result for this branch is `No divergence across all compared frames` for 140
frames `[10..1400]`. For the default 18-function aggregate set, use
`--ignore-wram 1F00-1FFF`; that range contains stale return-address scratch rather than live game
state.

## Publication checks

Before pushing this branch, the following were checked:

- the ROM is ignored and absent from the Git index;
- build products, snapshots, traces, save-states, and local configuration are absent;
- no absolute local filesystem paths, credentials, access tokens, or private keys are present in
  the branch diff;
- the generated source is reproducible from the checked-in generator/profile;
- the 26 Python generator tests and the Visual Studio Release build pass;
- the parent gitlink resolves to the published `snesrecomp` contribution branch.
